## ABOUT

An Iâ€™m an lnformation Technology (IT) Engineer with 8+ years of business Information Technology experience and a sound, adaptive technical background built on solid work ethics and personal discipline. 

Iâ€™m big on Technology-Related Business Solutions, Process Improvements, Storytelling, Professional growth, and Productive conversations in areas of Community Outreach, Books and the Business of Sports.

As a purpose driven problem solver, attempting to transition into Software Engineering with a foundation focus in Python, Iâ€™m excited about opportunities within software Development, Software Quality Assurance, Project Management, Product Management and Business Analysis centred roles among other things as I look forward to explore Rust & Golang in future.

My development started after my contract as a Software Projects Implementation Consultant (_Implementation Engineer to be precise_). I got a good perspective on what i should really focus on in order to be a good software engineer.

The goal being;- become a Software Engineer who can also do freelance work as a Software Developer working on or handing software projects(_Software Project Management_).

My preferred tech tools/stack of research, learning, perfecting and use includes ``Python/Django``, ``R Programming``, ``SQL (MySQL, MsSQL, PostgreSQL, NoSQLs)``, ``JSON``, ``NodeJS``, ``Full-stack Web (HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript(Typescript, React) & Wordpress)``, ``Git``, ``Excel/PowerBI,Tableau(For Data Analysis)``, everntually circling around to ``Rust`` & ``Go``. Ofcource with the emergency of GenAI, this technology growth path approach will be adjusting time and again.

My vision is to become a systems thinking-centered problem solver first and foremost, and then an industry thought leader in the technology with a well rounded technology background and hands-on experience.
