Disclaimer 
I love reading and tend to sometimes write about what I read as a way to confirm what I've learnt or just for the sheer thrill of sharing, know it will benefit someone immensely.

And while I don't claim to be the single of source of truth or original owner of some of the information in my publications, when i'm not sharing my own thoughts on focus areas of my writing, I do very much like to research, discover, curate, improve on or update where necessary and re-share valuable information I find resourceful, innovative, creative and intellectual nurturing to my learning and hopefully other people, that would ordinary not be found so easily based on where I found it or the trouble through which I go to find it. 

I hope those who come across my publications find it as resourceful and worthy of sharing as I did as well as also occasionally sharing useful updates, insightful remarks and suggestions or corrections where necessary.

I also make an effort where necessary to credit my sources by endeavouring to add source links at the end of most of articles in my References and Resources sections for my readers to find and also make use of.
